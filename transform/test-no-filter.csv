,"Agricultural and Food Fair ""AgFair""","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Every year, St. Croix hosts the largest agricultural festival in the Territory. AgriFest, is a colorful display of locally produced agricultural products, livestock, arts and crafts and native cuisine. Taking place over four days, festival goers can taste, touch and see everything on St. Croix that has to do with agricultural.</strong> There is a small admission fee to enter, but well worth it! Once inside the fair grounds, you can make your way though vendors selling a variety of goods and locally made products.</p>

,St. Croix Christmas Boat Parade,"<strong>A popular kick off to the holidays and the busy tourist season on St. Croix is our annual Christmas boat parade. The first parade took place in 1994 and has continued to be a way for the boating community of St. Croix to thank the residents and guests of St. Croix for their support of boating and fishing in St. Croix waters.</strong>

Over the years, boats have come and gone, but one thing remains true: the holiday spirit that everyone gets into. Businesses who operate boats as well as those who have their own pleasure crafts deck their boats with the most imaginative holiday and tropical décor! Santa and his reindeer, palm trees, lights galore, even appearances by a Harley Davidson and Moko Jumbies dancing on the boardwalk! A large crowd on the boardwalk enjoys the sight of the boats circling through Christiansted Harbor, cheering for their favorites!

<img class=""size-full wp-image-64222 alignnone"" src=""https://staging-gotostcroix.wordkeeper.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/lookbook_events_st-croix-christmas-boat-parade.jpg"" alt="""" width=""980"" height=""625"" />

Not only is it fun to watch the boats on the water, but the streets of Christiansted are abuzz with open air vendors, shops stay open late and restaurants offer parade specials on food and beverages. Be sure to arrive early as the boardwalk fills up fast!

,Day Tripping to Buck Island,"<strong>A trip to St. Croix would not be complete without day tripping to Buck Island. Located just 1 1/2 miles off the northeast shore of Christiansted, St. Croix, Buck Island is easily accessible from Christiansted, Green Cay Marina and the St. Croix Yacht Club. As one of only three Underwater National Monuments in the United States, Buck Island's unsurpassed natural beauty will calm and invigorate you. Accessible only by boat, there are several tour operators offering full and half day trips to the small island.</strong>

With even more enthusiasm than I had on my first journey there, I signed up for a full day trip with one of the tour operators located on the Christiansted Boardwalk. We left from the Christiansted boardwalk promptly at 9:30am after meeting the captain and crew. As we set sail for a full day at Buck Island we learned more about its history. First protected in 1948, the area was finally designated as a national monument in 1961. At that time, 176 acres of land, the surrounding water, and Buck Island's contents were protected by law. Before President Clinton left office, he widened the protected area to 19,800 acres. As tempting as it is, no shells, sand, or animals, whether dead or alive, are allowed to be taken from the property.

From the boat, the bright green hillsides of St. Croix stand out against the deep blue sea. Breathtaking homes and the historic ruins of sugar mills lightly sprinkle the landscape. Our sail continued and as we get further east, I notice the distant hills becoming dark. And yet, above me and my boat-mates, there was nothing but glorious sunshine. I was mesmerized by the rain bathing the hills in a sequenced, step-like pattern. Luckily, the rain stayed at a closeness only to admire and not touch. A little after 10 am, we anchored at our first stop, Turtle Beach.

[caption id=""attachment_74493"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1440""]<img class=""wp-image-74493 size-full"" src=""https://staging-gotostcroix.wordkeeper.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/edit_buck-island_beach_gopro.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1440"" height=""630"" /> Turtle Beach, Buck Island, St. Croix[/caption]

This white sandy beach is located on the northwest side of Buck Island and is usually quiet this time of morning. Turtle Beach is the nesting ground for many endangered species such as the brown pelican, the leatherback, hawksbill, and green sea turtles. The beach is perfect for lounging, long walks and splashing in the clear crisp tropical waters.One lucky snorkeler had the pleasure of making the acquaintance of Sammy, an outgoing stingray that has frequented Buck Island for several years. Visitors and locals who visit Buck Island have befriended Sammy and often feed her bits of squid. This has made her so tame that she will allow a petting, but will stick around with hopes of getting a treat. She has lost the barbs on her tail, so she poses no threat.

Back on the boat, we headed through a beautiful lagoon protected by the reef. On the way to the trail, I notice the rocky cliffs spilling over into the water. Buck Island possesses awesome terrain caused not by volcanic rock as one might think, but rather, an upheaval of Tectonic plates. Normally dry, the terrain allows mostly Cactus, Aloe and Casha to grow wildly. Around the island, Manchineel is also widely present. Once at the underwater trail, we grabbed our masks, fins and snorkels, and walked into the inviting ocean. We lined up, in pairs, for a guided tour of the trail, where brilliantly colored sea life fills the water in abundance. Sporadically placed markers briefly describe the types of fish and coral we see along the trail.

After a short guided tour, time is left to explore the garden in pairs. It was so peaceful to see, and be encompassed by, such intriguing beauty and stunning color. Around us, the coral stood tall and bright, with splashes of orange, yellow and bits of purple. The fish didn't seem to be afraid of us in their territory, but rather inquisitive. I saw a huge Parrot Fish that was primarily blue. His tail was yellow in color, blending into a green, back to blue, then purple and back to green. Several curious Yellow Tang stayed at close range, inquisitively looking at us until running into a much larger snapper. I was so enveloped in the fish and coral below that I almost ran face to face with a three foot long Barracuda. But, I was in his territory and since he wasn't moving, I did...and fast.

[caption id=""attachment_74495"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""1440""]<img class=""wp-image-74495 size-full"" src=""https://staging-gotostcroix.wordkeeper.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/edit_buck-island_tangs.jpg"" alt="""" width=""1440"" height=""630"" /> Blue tangs at the Buck Island underwater snorkel trail[/caption]

After working up an appetite, we got back on the boat, caught some more rays, and enjoyed our surroundings and mixed conversation with each other. We anticipated lunch at the beach a short sail from Buck Island. The tour I was on provides a beach barbecue with rum punch on their full day sails, and some others do as well. Anchored at the beach, we all admired the beauty of Buck and its glistening white sand. We volunteered to help unload coolers of rum punch, refreshments, and the makings of a great beach BBQ. While our captain cooked up hot dogs, hamburgers, and fresh tuna, most of the group sat around talking and getting to know each other, while others enjoyed the water until lunch was ready.

As the grill got started, a slight rustling in the bush caught my attention. When I searched for its origin, I found the culprit to be a hungry mongoose. Though these critters are somewhat like ferrets, they are wild and should not be confronted. We set out a few chips but they didn't last too long. Mongoose are common on St. Croix, especially where there's food. They were originally brought from England to heed the number of rats that were destroying the sugar cane fields. Because mongoose are active in daylight and rats are nocturnal, their purpose was misguided. But, as a result of their presence we can proudly say there are no snakes in the wild on St. Croix.

Once the food and rum punch was placed out, it was hard to leave the table. Some stood around the spread to be first in line for a second helping, while others adopted the island way of life and sat down to relax and savor the moment. With full bellies and salty skin, we packed up our things and headed back to Christiansted, leaving the beach and Buck Island behind us.

When I see the red roofs on buildings that dot Christiansted harbor, I know my day has come to an end. Tomorrow the boat and crew will set out to do it all over again, but I will have to hold onto this feeling until the next chance for a day trip to Buck.

,Family Fun at the Crab Races,"<strong>Ladies and gentlemen, start your...hermit crabs? That's right, here on St. Croix one of the most well attended sporting events on island is the weekly crab races. Held at multiple resort, bar and restaurant locations across the island, these 'high-stakes' racing events are fun for the whole family.</strong> <strong>You can pick a crab and participate, or just watch the fun, either way the crab races are always a delightful (and budget friendly) pastime.</strong>

Here on St. Croix, the people understand better than most that the perfect work week begins and ends with a few laughs. From this understanding (and maybe a few libations), the ritualistic pastime of evening Soldier Crab Races was born. The tradition of Soldier Crab Racing started as a form of entertainment centuries ago, so while crab racing is not a new form of entertainment by any means, it is experiencing a fun resurgence thanks to local favorite husband and wife team, Tito and Sue. For over twenty years now, Tito, a lifelong resident of St. Croix, has been carrying on the crab racing tradition with the help of his wife, Sue. Tito and Sue continue to entertain us all and help the week start and end with a few laughs, and some great prizes too.

How do the crab races work? Participants start by choosing their crabs for $2 each and naming them. The crabs get a little name tag on their shell once they have been chosen and named, and then they are put into a bucket to be queued up until race time. The buckets of competing crabs are then placed upside down, with the crabs captive inside, on the course starting point. The course is a set of concentric circles, like a bull’s-eye, and the crabs start in the center and race outward. When it's race time, Sue sounds the official starting kazoo and the race is on! The buckets are lifted off the crabs and they take off (some much more quickly than others). The winner is the first crab to makes it outside the course circle.

<iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/MkfoFF3MytM?rel=0"" width=""590"" height=""315"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen=""allowfullscreen""></iframe>

There are four heats in the crab races, then there’s a 'runoff' among the winners of the four heats.  The winning crabs are chosen from the final two heats, and they earn their 'sponsors' some fantastic prizes such as seaplane tickets, gift certificates for shopping or dining, trips to Buck Island, Caribbean jewelry, bottles of rum, and more. The best part is, none of the kids leave feeling as though they lost. When all the prizes have been given out to the actual winners, Tito and Sue round-up the little ones and hand out surprises. I guess you could say, it’s a win-win situation.

The crab races are an island tradition that is fun for the whole family. Come and pick your crab for a chance to win great prizes, or come for the fun and cheer on the racers. With or without kids, the crab races are hysterical, cheap fun and everyone gets into the act.

<strong>Check out one of these weekly crab races with Tito and Sue:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Wednesdays: 5:00pm* at Brew STX</li>
 	<li>Fridays: 5pm at Leatherback Brewing Company</li>
</ul>
*Please note that in true island fashion, times are subject to change. If you are here during St. Croix's off-season (July-October) and plan to attend the crab races make sure to call ahead and confirm the races are still on.

,"Cruzan Rum, a St. Croix Tradition","<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Cruzan Rum, has been voted one of the best in the world, and is a large source of local island pride as a rum whose roots date as far back as the 17th century. Only on St. Croix is it possible to tour the rum distillery to learn the history and see production of Cruzan Rum through the distillery process. It is a sensory experience to see, smell, touch, and taste various aspects of Cruzan Rum, and we highly recommend this tour to everyone on St. Croix.</strong></p>

<p>Since the early 17th century, St. Croix has been making use of its natural resources locally as well as exporting them worldwide, most notably, rum. At one time, over 150 plantations were producing molasses and rum at their factories. Today, the tradition of making rum on St. Croix is carried on and unfolds from the moment you step foot onto the property.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When you enter the distillery you'll find remnants of the original plantation, Estate Diamond, amid the state-of-the-art distillery. The old sugar mill now serves as a cistern for the distillery, and the estate's former great house now serves as the distillery's main office. A 19th century chimney is now enclosed and houses the boilers. Like the times, things must change. Additional office space had to be added to the grounds to accommodate their employees, but other than that, the past of this plantation has been well preserved by the use of the existing buildings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<figure class=""wp-block-image alignleft""><img src=""https://staging-gotostcroix.wordkeeper.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/edit_cruzan-rum_sugarmill-flags-1024x448.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-93024""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our tour started under a shaded pavilion where our tour guide, Biggie, gave us a safety briefing and told shared the history of the estate,  the Cruzan Rum Nelthropp family, and an overview of how rum is made.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The process of making rum starts with sugar cane, the juice of which is turned into molasses.&nbsp; Due to the high volume of rum produced by Cruzan Rum, they have molasses delivered by tanker trucks and transferred to distillery tanks where it's diluted with rainwater and then boiled at 400 degrees. The mixture is then cooled to room temperature and transferred to the 'seed tanks'. Yeast and more rainwater are then added to total 500 gallons of the mixture.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""align"":""left"",""id"":93030} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image alignleft""><img src=""https://staging-gotostcroix.wordkeeper.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/edit_cruzan-rum_tour-beginning-1024x448.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-93030""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sixteen hours later, billions of yeast cultures are alive and working in each gallon. This is then transferred to fermenters, where more water and molasses are added. The yeast eats the sugar, converting it into alcohol. The remaining mix is three parts water, and one part molasses. The mixture is now called 'beer' (not like the kind found in your friendly tavern, even though&nbsp;it is brown and foamy). Only 10% of this mixture is used in the rum. Sound interesting? &nbsp;Wait until you see (and smell) it up close! One of my favorite things about this tour is getting to walk beside the tanks and actually look into them and see the process as it is happening!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""align"":""left"",""id"":93025} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image alignleft""><img src=""https://staging-gotostcroix.wordkeeper.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/edit_cruzan-rum_fermenting-tanks-1024x448.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-93025""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next, the actual distilling begins. Cruzan Rum uses a multi-column distillation process that removes nearly all impurities from the rum, including fusel oils. Fusel oil is what causes hangovers (so there you go, another reason to drink Cruzan Rum, no hangovers). When the distillation process is complete, the rum&nbsp;is clear. The golden brown color is given to the rum by the barrels in which it is stored.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""align"":""left"",""id"":93048} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image alignleft""><img src=""https://staging-gotostcroix.wordkeeper.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/edit_cruzan-rum_distillation-tower-and-tanks-1024x448.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-93048""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The American made, once-used, charred white oak barrels are bought from Jim Beam and are steamed upon arrival to remove any residue flavors or fusel oils from the bourbon previously stored in them. The rum is then stored in the barrels for anywhere from 1 to 12 years. The time in the barrels mellows the flavor of the rum and gives it the rich golden color. Cruzan Estate Light and Dark Rums are made using the rum from barrels that have been stored between 1 to 4 years. An extra filtering process eliminates the color to produce the light rum.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {""align"":""left"",""id"":93054} -->
<figure class=""wp-block-image alignleft""><img src=""https://staging-gotostcroix.wordkeeper.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/edit_cruzan-rum_barrel-room-1024x448.jpg"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-93054""/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the rum has been aged, it's moved to the newest part of Cruzan Rum distillery, where the bungs (or corks) are removed and the rum is drained into a holding tank and charcoal filtered to refine the color and flavor.&nbsp;While the Nelthropp family still operates the distillery and handles the rum production, bottling of the rum is now done off-island at a sister facility owned by Beam Suntory, the current owner of Cruzan Rum. &nbsp;Once the rums are aged at the Cruzan distillery, they are then loaded into tankers and shipped stateside to begin the packaging and distribution process. According to Karen Nelthropp, this arrangement leaves the Nelthropp family to do what they have been doing best for generations, making rum. This system makes a lot of sense when you consider that only 15% of the rum is sold here in the local market while the other 85% is sent to the United States and beyond.</p>

<p>At the visitor center main pavilion, our guide became our bartender and we finally got to taste the smooth and delicious rum. Estate Diamond Rum, named after the estate in which the distillery resides, is aged 5 to 12 years. Cruzan Single Barrel aged rums are also available and is great for those who appreciate sipping a good rum.&nbsp; As many of you know, there are many flavored rums available including mango, key lime, pineapple, coconut, banana, orange, spiced, and blackstrap molasses. At the conclusion of the tour you step up to the Sampling Bar and each guest gets their choice of 2 mixed drinks from the drink menu and up to 4 samples of any the Cruzan Rums.&nbsp; Children are welcome, and will get their choice of 2 juices or soft drinks in lieu of rum.&nbsp;</p>

For anyone visiting St. Croix be sure to note that the duty-free allowance is 6 bottles of rum per adult for US citizens! The employees at Cruzan will even bubble wrap and box their rum for airline travel for only a few extra dollars. Make sure to visit this fun and historic attraction while you are on St. Croix. </p>

<p>The Cruzan Rum Distillery is open* Monday through Friday and currently offers tours at 12:00pm, 1:30pm, 3:00pm, which now requires advanced booking (it's super easy). If you've already been, you'll want to go back for the upgraded visitor experience, a Cruzan Rum drink made at Cruzan Rum. Plus, fresh merchandise. After four years of upgrades, Cruzan Rum is glad to welcome everyone back to the ‘Don’t Hurry Rum’ distillery!</p>
