Filter out beaver builder tags from content, such as '<!-- wp:fl-builder/layout -->'.

Use a default address of '123 King Street' if one is not provided.

We need a new mapping for Categories and Tags in an external json file (already
created and named categories_and_tags.json), including a name (from the ACF 
custom fields) to an id. Categories are not text based. GeoDirectory must use 
an internal map. For example: Uncategorized is 2040. Play is 2041. Scuba is 
2042. Eat is 2043.
